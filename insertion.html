    <h2 class="text-info">Insertion Sort</h2>
    <p>
        Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info">How it works</h3>
    <p>Consider an array arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}</p>
    <ul>
        <p>First Pass:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially, the first two elements of the array are compared in insertion sort.
            arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}</li> 
            <li>Here, 12 is greater than 11 hence they are not in the ascending order and 12 is not at its correct position. Thus, swap 11 and 12.</li>
            <li>So, for now 11 is stored in a sorted sub-array.
            arr[] = {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Second Pass:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now, move to the next two elements and compare them. 
            arr[] = {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}</li>
            <li>Here, 13 is greater than 12, thus both elements seems to be in ascending order, hence, no swapping  will occur. 12 also stored in a sorted sub-array along with 11.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Third Pass:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now, two elements are present in the sorted sub-array which are 11 and 12</li>
            <li>Moving forward to the next two elements which are 13 and 5
            arr[] = {11, 12, 13, 5, 6}</li>
            <li>Both 5 and 13 are not present at their correct place so swap them
            arr[] = {11, 12, 5, 13, 6}</li>
            <li>After swapping, elements 12 and 5 are not sorted, thus swap again
            arr[] = {11, 5, 12, 13, 6}</li>
            <li>Here, again 11 and 5 are not sorted, hence swap again
            arr[] = {5, 11, 12, 13, 6}</li>
            <li>Here, it is at its correct position</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Fourth Pass:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now, the elements which are present in the sorted sub-array are 5, 11 and 12</li>
            <li>Moving to the next two elements 13 and 6
            arr[] = {5, 11, 12, 13, 6}</li>
            <li>Clearly, they are not sorted, thus perform swap between both
            arr[] = {5, 11, 12, 6, 13}</li>
            <li>Now, 6 is smaller than 12, hence, swap again
            arr[] = {5, 11, 6, 12, 13}</li>
            <li>Here, also swapping makes 11 and 6 unsorted hence, swap again
            arr[] = {5, 6, 11, 12, 13}</li>
            <li>Finally, the array is completely sorted.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
